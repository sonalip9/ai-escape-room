# Database Security Recommendations (LDB-11)

## Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation

To complete the leaderboard security implementation, consider adding Supabase Row Level Security policies to prevent direct database manipulation.

### Recommended RLS Policies for Leaderboard Table

1. **Read Policy**: Allow all users to read leaderboard entries

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users" ON "public"."leaderboard"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (true);
```

2. **Insert Policy**: Restrict inserts to authenticated sessions or API-only

```sql
-- Option 1: Require authentication
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for authenticated users only" ON "public"."leaderboard"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Option 2: API-only inserts (requires service role key)
-- This would require modifying the app to use service role for inserts
-- and removing public insert permissions entirely
```

3. **Prevent Updates and Deletes**: Leaderboard entries should be immutable

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Prevent updates" ON "public"."leaderboard"
AS RESTRICTIVE FOR UPDATE
TO public
USING (false);

CREATE POLICY "Prevent deletes" ON "public"."leaderboard"
AS RESTRICTIVE FOR DELETE
TO public
USING (false);
```

### Additional Security Measures

1. **Rate Limiting at Database Level**: Consider adding triggers to enforce rate limiting
2. **Data Validation**: Add database-level constraints for time_seconds and name validation
3. **Audit Trail**: Consider adding triggers to log all leaderboard modifications
4. **API Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate Supabase API keys
5. **IP Whitelisting**: In production, consider IP restrictions for database access

### Implementation Status

- ✅ Application-level rate limiting implemented
- ✅ Application-level anti-cheat validation implemented
- ❌ Database RLS policies not yet implemented (requires database admin access)
- ❌ Database-level constraints not yet implemented

### Migration Script Template

```sql
-- Enable RLS on leaderboard table
ALTER TABLE "public"."leaderboard" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add the policies above
-- (policies listed above would go here)

-- Add database constraints
ALTER TABLE "public"."leaderboard"
  ADD CONSTRAINT leaderboard_time_check
  CHECK (time_seconds >= 5 AND time_seconds <= 1800);

ALTER TABLE "public"."leaderboard"
  ADD CONSTRAINT leaderboard_name_check
  CHECK (char_length(trim(name)) >= 1 AND char_length(trim(name)) <= 50);
```

### Testing RLS Policies

After implementing RLS policies, test them by:

1. Attempting direct inserts via Supabase client
2. Verifying API endpoints still work correctly
3. Testing with different authentication states
4. Monitoring for any bypass attempts
